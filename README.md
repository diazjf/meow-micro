Contains MicroServices which send and receive cat names. It is used
in the Distributed Tracing tutorial found here:

## Running Locally

In order to run locally simply perform the following:

1. Install Dependencies
    ```
    go install ...
    ```
2. Start the server
    ```
    $ go run server/server.go
    ```
3. Start the client
    ```
    $ go run client/client.go
    ```
4. Send a Request to the client-server:
    ```
    $ curl 127.0.0.1:5002 -X POST -d '{"body": "Meow-Mixer"}'
    ```

## Deploying to Kubernetes

I have included deployment scripts for deploying to Docker-Desktop Kubernetes.
There are some pre-requisites required before running the below:

- Docker-Desktop
- Helm v3

1. Clean environment
```
$ make clean
```

2. Build Docker Images
```
$ make build
```

3. Install via Helm Chart
```
$ make install
```

## Troubleshooting

1. Exec into the meow-client pod

2. install grpcurl
```
go get github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl/...
go install github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl/cmd/grpcurl
```

3. Verify you can access the GRPC Service

```
grpcurl -d '{"body": "Meow-Mixer"}' -plaintext meow-server-svc:5001 chat.ChatService/SayHello

{
  "body": "Meow-Mixer"
}
```
